# digimunne

A web application built for DeltaHacks that allows users to store vaccincation records in an easy to use interface.  

This project was built with the Django framework on the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the frontend.  
It uses the Google Machine Vision API to parse data from scanned copies of vaccination records.  

*Note this feature was not working too well - further development of the OCR should be done in the future*
